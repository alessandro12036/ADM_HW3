    "<br><br>\n",
    "Specifically, the user can submit the query in one of two ways: either directly in the format \"query \\[parameter1=x, parameter2=y...\\]\" or, if the string is not provided, through a form that collects the data for each field and then assembles the same string so that the inner logic of the algorithm doesn't change regardless of the way the query is collected.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The function process_query then collects each field and returns a dictionary containing all the relevant information.\n",

    "We then proceed to evaluate the cosine distance between the tfidf scores of each document including all the words in the query and the query itself as we did before, but we also assess whether the fields specified in the query match with those of the documents we analyzed and we accordingly create a specific vector of booleans called vector_parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector is then used to compute the Tanimoto Distance with the query (we assume for the query a vector of all 1s).\n",

    "The reason why we adopted a specific distance measure for the parameters rather than using the cosine distance is that the latter performs very poorly on boolean vectors.\n",

    "It's important to notice that since the Tanimoto distance is computed across five different parameters, each parameter weighs 1/5 of the total score and thus does not have the potential, alone, to overturn a match in the main query.\n",
